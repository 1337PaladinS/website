								<p>Dear V</p>
								<p>I am writing this letter to you while I am packing up life as I know it in England into two suitcases as I am coming home to you. This candid work in progress style writing ensures a more complete account of what I have to say rather than engineered prose that one may like to hear, so allow me to be brave. Even though this letter is one way written dialogue, down the road, Iâ€™d like this to be a discussion rather than discourse.  I am of the opinion that humility is an ample, accurate and sorrowful recognition of all of oneâ€™s failings. It is filled with apology and modesty. It is an open admission that one wishes to be different and better. Although, in your case I opine that your humility and emotional brilliance is a powerful, unique and ample ode to your strength of which I for one am a fan. I am sure as one gets to know you more and more, one would be admissive of the fact that you are in all ways in your own class.</p>
								<p>For the longest time, being out of love gave me a unique perspective on life. Unfettered by the burden of the heart my mind interpreted this world as only black and white with little room for some greys. The perhaps once loving, kind and accommodating boy had for the longest time devolved into a man most ruthless and stoic all the while intelligibly keeping up appearances of being unchanged. Being able to faithfully recuperate the actual information on what it is like to exist and to â€˜liveâ€™ would emphatically prove instrumental in captivating others, a con I have been most guilty of most of my adult life. </p>
								</section>
								<section id="19/11">
								<p>I am separated from those who are crushed by emotional failure as I greet the troubles of the lack of love with melancholy and a darkly humorous resilience and am appreciative of the role of well-handled pessimism within the overall economy of a good life. What invariably proved compelling for me personally is when I internally confronted what I truly felt â€“ regret, mourning, and the constant feeling that I am being burnt alive. Over time the magma of my mind cooled to clay, but my sense of romance calcified into the benign sadness that seemingly always pervades my eyes. For a very long time I always wondered whether one could experience variety in the overall economy of the journey of being in love. In my experience it has been akin a perilous situation like giving a person a knife pointed at your heart and hoping they wonâ€™t drive it in. Howeverâ€¦â€¦</p>
								<p>â€¦â€¦â€¦.. we still open our eyes to bloodied hands.</p>
								</section>
								<section id="20/11">
								<p>Eye of my own storm, I have always been calm through the crests and troughs of life through all the chaos, madness and pain when suddenly â€¦â€¦â€¦ you.</p>
								<p>Suddenly there is someone who, though outspoken, is an attentive self-aware listener and a reliable, honest correspondent of the tremors of their own heart, and one who gave me a most faithful account of the pathos, drama and strangeness of being alive. You gave me what I deeply wanted from social intercourse which is an uncensored glimpse of what the brief waking dream of life looks like and the reassurance that I am not entirely alone with the burden of my own sensibilities, a feeling most bewildering, peculiar and INTENSE. However, as adults we refuse to trust the inherent wisdom of our feelings. Just like the expression of hatred may mask love, like anger or resentment may mask sadness, we are prone to huge and costly inaccuracies around whom we desire and what we really want.</p>
								</section>
								<section id="25/11">
								<p>I have glimpsed your life through a small sieve in time, however I have heard of you experience both smooth sailing and rocky roads. My initial intrigue soon made way for faith in you as my closest friend, as a result of the same my guard came down and gave way to vulnerability. Your wit and uncanny ability to make me laugh has had me begging for more as fleeting puppy love made way for a feeling for you closer to veneration.</p>
								<p>It is sometimes difficult for me to express myself in a way that would make someone trust my perception of the world, but I know for a fact that in more ways than oneâ€¦â€¦.. you get me ðŸ˜Š</p>
								<p>We are all broken or cracked in our own slight ways which makes one believe that expecting perfection in a person or relationship is not without a sense of obsolescence, that we are all slightly crazy and definitely not without failings. Every time I have ever day dreamed of holding you in my arms my walls of Jericho have fallen, and I have been flooded with the strongest desire to go on in this life with stronger resolve than before, to give myself a chance at something near perfect and most profound. I however sometimes fall prey to the notion that I must set you free and not allow my feelings to be incumbent in your life unless you reciprocate unequivocally due to your romantic chaffing which has been a long-standing theme. </p>
								</section>
								<section id="28/11">
								<p>At this juncture V, I want to promise you something, I want to give you the reassurance that you are not alone with the burden of whatever weighs you down between your ears, that you would find it prudent to always be slightly crazy, always find a reason to go on in this though imperfect life, a life filled with profundities that you must explore and perhaps if providence permits explore together.</p>
								<p>You are the most beautiful girl in the world and I also want to point out that you would always be loved. Flowers are easy, but due to the nature of our relationship, I will always write to you, write you stories, and over time create a universe just for you.</p>
								<p>V, you are my fondest treasure, and I want you to be happy forever, I am always by your side.</p>
								<p>Yours</br>
								S</p>
