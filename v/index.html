								<h2>The Premise</h2>
								<p>It's the 12:25AM on the 19th of December and I have just returned home from Connaught Circus. It's a short drive home but it feels like a day has passed (well it was the 18th when it happened) since I gazed upon your face in warm embrace and expressed how I felt. My feet are on warm ground in the cold delhi winter due to the heater being on it's beat true to time, trajectory and temperament just like my now acceleratedly beating heart.
								I look at the dressing mirror in my room and recite with a familiar chime </br>.</br>.</br>.</br>.</br>"FUCK!"

								<h2>Challenges</h2>
								<p>It's early morning on the 19th and you're dressed in the BEST warm 
								black jersey you could be in :P. I am hoodied up, holding you by your jersey pockets in front
								of the mirror as we take a selfie. I am wearing a comical smile for the sake of the camera
								, an ode to savoring the moment but it is dishonest at best. Dishonest because my heart is asunder
								thinking about two specific things.
								</p>
								<ul>
								<li>You were leaving for meerut :( and I wanted more time together, a long standing wish with never ending demand.</li>
								<li>Having subscribed to my emotional honesty and asking you out, 
								I may have plausibly signed up for longing and a most arduous wait.</li>

								<h2>Contingencies</h2>
								<p>At the time, I did not have any designs on how to effectively prove to you how much I wanted this, 
								but if we had lived in more Gatsbyesque times I would probably have some novel ideas on how to go 
								about this wonderful position we have put ourselves in. We had been speaking for two months 
								and then suddenly I found myself staring into your eyes, on your bed, saying that I loved you.
								Would the initial honeymoon culminate into an accretion of petty arguments and 
								resentful compromises which, like water torture, inevitably transforms both 
								parties into screaming, neurosis ridden versions of their former selves?

								<h2>Considerations</h2>
								<p>Despite the more dangerous path taken, akin a tightrope walk over a sea of misery, I am driven 
								by my view of you on the other side - one that not only speaks to life's inherent justice but also  
								it's specious love of irony. Stoicism, independence and emotional invulnerability were luminaries 
								I once orbited, however, being with you all this while has healthily untethered me from them and 
								has rendered me with a broader self assessment and the confidence that I could do better, for 
								the both of us. When I said I wanted to wither away with you, I meant it.

								<h2>Complexities</h2>
								<p>Fun is a given when I am with you, sometimes 
								so much that I resign myself to a few moments of balance just to remind myself the fleeting nature 
								of our mortalitity and how being with you sometimes felt too good to be true. It is only when a 
								sojourn of togetherness ends and the distance betwixt us starts to break my spirit do I yield a 
								sigh of relief....it is'nt perfect. It is a reprieve to pick up my phone and text you, 
								and to look at your pictures, they remind me of all that's good in this world while offsettting 
								greatly the almost tangible pain in my heart when I am without you.

								<h2>Confluence</h2>
								<p>Not one to ever skip tough conversations, I always have felt that for me the path to a tender future
								had been gently but firmly closed off. I felt that, providentially, I had recognized the despicable truth that
								with a smile I had been shunted into the category of the romantically failed and the lightly despised. 
								It was refreshing to find out that one could not have been more wrong. In this time with you thus far 
								I have found myself unburdened almost completely by finding love such as yours that healed me of my  
								preconceptions ......... and also saved me.

								<h2>Confession</h2>
								<p>My love for you in most ways is traditional, but in time I felt it evolve into the veneration 
								I spoke of in my first letter to you. Infatuation needs perfection in order to survive and meanders 
								in illusion, but I love you and that can survive reality. Albeit our homes are separated by a 1427 km drive :P
								in spirit I am always right by your side. You are the most beautiful girl in the world V, and the love of my life.
								</br></br>
								I love you.</br>
