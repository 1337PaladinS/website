								<p>My Dearest Wife V</p>
								<p>I write this letter as I fondly look back with gratitude at the first four years of our marriage while eagerly anticipating you coming home to me. This piece is more candid as the last the reason for which will be apparent to you as my humble machinations come to a crescendo later today. Every waking moment of my life with you has been one filled with boundless love and joy yet there is a yearning in my heart that I need to convey to you, that I am filled with epiphanous apology.</p>
								<p>Being in love with you has been the greatest gift and for the very first time I finally was able to see the white amongst the black that is my life. Your description of me as someone who is crag like on the outside but cake like soft and moist on the inside (with the inclusion of the mild devilishness within) has helped me realize who I am and what I need to be...... </p>
								
								<p>..... better.</p>
								<p>I'd like you to allow me to apologize, for all what I've done and for all that I have not and with it an opportunity to promise you a better me in the form of better health, wealth and happiness. My gratitude that I get to love you everyday is akin the classic characteristic of mania, an ability to repeatedly want to do the samething with same results, because you are my world and loving you is easiest thing in it.</p>
							
								
								<p>Growth and understanding have been the cornerstone and bedrock of our relationship. Through mutual exploration we have reached this checkpoint later than expected in some places but sooner than many in most with happiness and in love.</p>
								<p>Sitting in my study I reach out to your curvaceous bosom in my mind's eye with the longing to feel your softness against my skin, our lips intertwined as I firmly press your being against mine, my tumescence in eager & roaring anticipation of your return.</p>
								
								<p>You are mine, and I am yours.</p>
								<p>Always.</p>
								<p>Love & Lust</br>
								S</p>
