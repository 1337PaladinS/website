								<p>The CVV is a 3 or 4 digit code embossed or imprinted on the reverse side of Visa and MasterCard credit cards. This is an extra security measure to ensure that you have access or physical possession of the credit card itself in order to use the CVV code.

								<li>For State Bank of India (SBI) cards, there is a 19 digit number printed on the front of the credit card, of which the first 16 digits are the credit card number and the last three digits are the CVV code.</li>
								</ul>

								<h3>My payment has been rejected, but my credit card has been charged? What do I do?</h3>
								<p>This is a very rare situation, and can occur in case of a network fluctuation at the venue at the time of confirming the transaction. In this case, a reverse request for the charge on your card will be sent by us the same day to the bank.</p>
								
								<h3>The refund has still not been credited in my credit card account</h3>
								<p>As per our company policy, we send a reverse request to the bank by the end of the day. Depending on each bank's policy, it can sometimes take up to 15 working days for the reversal to take effect.</p>
								
								<h3>In spite of several reminders, the refund is still not reflecting on my card.</h3>
								<p>As per our company's policy, a reversal request is sent to the bank by the end of the day from our end. It can take up to 10 working days for the reversal, depending upon the card issuing bank for the amount to reflect in your account.
