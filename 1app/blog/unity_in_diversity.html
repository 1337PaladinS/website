									<h4>Unity in Diversity</h4>
									<p>Oishek Ray - 23.04.2016</p>

									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/keepcalmsmall.jpg" alt="" /></span><strong>College applications in India are a mixed bag</strong>, where <strong><em>each institution has its own rules and guidelines</em></strong>, as well as its own, unique, admission system. Understandably, 
									students can be overwhelmed by the pressure of applying to multiple colleges via post or the internet - on top of which they have to deal with the attendant deadlines, 
									swarms of official documents, and difficult, often vague instructions that confuse rather than clarify.</p>
									
									<p><u><em>The need of the hour is unity.</em></u> As with the recent Supreme Court decision with N.E.E.T. (National Eligibility cum Enterance Test), there needs to be standardisation in the college application procedure as well. 
									This will do away with the need to fill out the same information over and over again, as well as <strong><em>streamline the application process for the student.</strong></em></p>
									
									<p><strong>1Application is a start-up geared towards achieving exactly this.</strong> With a vision of simplifying college admissions throughout the country, 1Application provides a robust, 
									dependable platform via which a student can apply safely and comfortably to multiple colleges â€“ all from the convenience of their own home.</p>
									
									<p>1Application is <em>wholly internet-based.</em> What this means for the student is an <em>end to long lines</em> outside the admissions offices, and freedom from mailing in applications 
									through the postal service (which in itself is costly). It means the facility of making a lump sum payment of all application fees at once, without the hassle of separate 
									demand drafts.</p>
									
									<p><em><u>Why does platform like 1Application become relevant?</u></em> Simply because our whole infrastructure has been built to level the playing field for every student as well as
									in the country. Now, it no longer matters whether the University you are applying to is 10km or 1000km away from home. Now, you no longer have to stay over in a different city simply so that you can have a 
									chance of participating in the admission process, nor does it require you to use archaic modes of fee payment that doesnt do justice to the value of your time.
									At 1Application, we believe that all students can benefit from having a clear, direct road to admissions offices of all colleges, without the need of a middleman or contact.</p>
									
									<p>Currently, 1Application has partnered with every prestigious private institution in India, and will soon be handling the admissions enquiries for public and government-aided 
									colleges as well. The company is also in talks with several leading colleges overseas and abroad in order to facilitate a healthy flow of Indian students to premier 
									institutions all over the world.</p>
									
									<p><strong><em>1Application is poised to revolutionise the Indian admissions scene, bringing a new wave of ease and transparency to your college dreams. Be sure to sign up for the 
									admissions season this 2016!</strong></em></p>
