									<h4>Rise of the liberal</h4>
									<p>Ishika Ray - 13.05.2016</p>
									</header>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/groupsmall.jpg" alt="" /></span><em>Steve Jobs used to say that, had it not been for the calligraphy class he took at 
									Reed College, a liberal arts college Oregon, the Macintosh would have never happened.</em> While Jobs never graduated college, there is no denying the value of a liberal arts 
									education.</p>
									
									<p>The past few years have seen a shift in education systems in East Asia. Countries like China, Singapore, Japan and South Korea are partnering with universities to 
									create more research-based programs. Institutions such as Seoul National University, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Kyung Hee University, Waseda University, and Ewha 
									Womans University are developing liberal arts style curricula, and tie-ups with US institutions have included Yale-NUS and NYU-Shanghai.</p>
									
									<p>India, too, has seen a surge of liberal arts colleges. These programs are growing year by year, and are not just popular among undergraduates, but also among 
									post-graduate students who want to widen their skill set. The problem lies with elite educational institutions, where the intense focus on science and engineering 
									courses has resulted in complete neglect of the humanities. It is one of the biggest reasons why India is faced with 40% reduction in engineering colleges (as proposed by 
									the AICTE). A staggering <u>80% of all engineering graduates in 2015 were deemed unemployable</u>, which is a glaring sign that these students would be considered more employable 
									in other fields. Liberal arts is one of the many solutions to this issue. Not only does liberal arts provide a wholesome education (with subjects ranging from history 
									and sociology to the pure sciences), it also makes students more employable inherently. It fosters a tradition of innovation thinking that is indispensable in a world 
									where the best employees are those who can adapt to any situation.</p>
									
									<p>In the words of Yes Bank’s Group president and Head of Business Development, R Ravichander: <em>“Because, while we may want to ‘Make in India’ now, we will 
									eventually also want to ‘Create in India’, and where is innovation without the liberal arts?”</em></p>
