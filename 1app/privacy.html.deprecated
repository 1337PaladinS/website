                    <p>Through our independent web service providers, _________________________, 1Application's Web Site collects, uses, and distributes to those member Colleges and/or Universities that you select personally identifiable information collected about you on-line. All personal information that you submit to us is handled within India. Please read carefully the following Privacy Policy before registering with us and completing an on-line user registration form. Please note that this Policy only addresses 1Application's privacy practice concerning information collected from its own web site and does not apply to information that may have been collected about you by others. This Policy also does not cover the privacy or information practices of those web sites that may be linked to or referenced by the 1Application web site or the privacy or information practices of those Colleges and/or Universities or other partners of ours that receive the personal information that is collected from our site and distributed to them as part of the application admissions process or other purpose. Please also note that this Policy may change from time to time so please check back to review this Policy each time you visit or use the web site that we own and operate.</p>
                    
                   <legend id="legend-col">Changes/Modifications in this Privacy Policy Statement</legend>
                   <p>If we decide to change our Privacy Policy or email practices we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>

                   <legend id="legend-col">Reservation of Rights by CAPL</legend>
                   <p>By using our Service to apply to any of our members, you consent and we reserve the right to use your data collected under a previous privacy practice in ways that are consistent with the current disclosed practice but which may not be entirely consistent with previous disclosed practices when your data was originally collected.</p>                   
                   

                   <legend id="legend-col">What Personally Identifiable Information (PII) does 1Application collect from you?</legend>
                   <p>Through our trustworthy independent web service providers, 1Application collects information in several ways from different parts of our web site.</p>
                   <p>Certain required and optional personal information (such as your name, home and mailing address, email address, telephone number, citizenship, date and place of birth, parents' names and address, including the names, telephone numbers and/or email addresses of your parents or legal guardian) is collected from you when you voluntarily provide this information to us through the completion of an on-line User Registration form and/or when you voluntarily complete the 1Application (TM) form, any application supplements, or other applicant forms. This personal information is collected from you voluntarily when you complete your "profile" screen as part of the registration process. During registration, 1Application asks you to create a username and password. Your personal information including any personal information of your parents or legal guardian that you provide shall be considered to be “your personal information” for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Once you register you are no longer anonymous to 1Application and your email address that you provide to us becomes your “User Name” so that you are able to take full advantage of 1Application's online services. You can also enter your credit card/debit card information to pay for admission application fees for the member Colleges and/or Universities that you select. This is accomplished by linking you to the ________________web site which collects your credit card/debit card information on our behalf and on behalf of our members. See "The kind of security precautions that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information, including your credit card/debit card information and how is your information stored and accessed by others" on how we keep your credit card/debit card information secure.</p>
                   <p>Wherever we collect personal information we make an effort to include a link or reference to this Privacy Policy on that page.</p>
         
                  <legend id="legend-col">What are tracking technologies and how are they used?</legend>
                  <p>Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by us and/or our web service and technology support providers to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic and aggregate data (see “who is collecting information”) about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as on an aggregated basis.</p>
                  <p>We also use cookies for authentication purposes, to remember your web site settings and preferences, to gain certain behavioural information about you that is shared between us and our members and to provide you with targeted advertising from our members even if you leave our site or one of our member’s sites and browse other non-affiliated web sites (“re-target advertising”). Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject all cookies, you may still use our site but your ability to use some features or areas of our site may be severely limited, including possibly not being able to use those 1Application (TM) services that require registration in order to participate.</p>
                  <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically-collected data to other information we collect about you.</p>
                  <p>We also use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.</p>
                   
                  <legend id="legend-col">How does 1Application use applicant information?</legend>
                  <p>When you seek to register with us, complete a 1Application (TM), an application supplement and/or other applicant form, we need to know your name, email address, telephone number and mailing address among other items of personal information, including the names, telephone numbers, and/or email addresses of your parents or legal guardian. See "What Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected from you". This information, requested by the Colleges and/or Universities, allows them to identify you and process your application upon submission.</p>
                  <p>Unless you affirmatively select the "opt-in" option described in the Section entitled "What are your choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information, including your rights to "opt-in" or "opt-out", users of the web site who use our services to apply to various member Colleges and/or Universities will not receive any College/University specific information concerning their respective admissions process; however, we may use your email address (User Name) and your cell phone number (if you opt in) to send you registration and submission confirmation texts and/or emails, to contact the user/applicant to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the site, and for us and our members to provide other information relevant to your admission application process. The admission application process shall include such matters associated with processing a request for financial aid, reminding you of application admission deadlines, encouraging you to complete an unfinished application or to provide you with general marketing information about any member regardless of whether you have applied or intend to apply to a member.</p>
                    
                  <legend id="legend-col">How does 1Application use school official information?</legend>
                  <p>By registering with our site your collected personal information may be shared and used by our member Colleges and/or Universities to contact you at any time and for any reason, including sending you texts to your cell phone number(s), written communications to your home mailing address, and/or emails to your email address in order to provide you with other information relevant to your admission application process. This information that we collect and share with our members includes your name, your official title, your email address, your cell phone number, your zip code as well as your home mailing address and date of birth. Also, you can submit your credit card/debit card payment information to us in order to pay for admission application fees for the member Colleges and/or Universities that you select, including the ability to transmit recommendations, transcripts and/or other admission related documents. Note that collecting your credit card/debit card information is accomplished by linking you to the _______________web site which collects your credit card/debit card information on our behalf and on behalf of our members.</p>
                   <p style="background: yellow;">Unless you affirmatively select the "opt-in" option described in the Section entitled "What are your choices regarding collection, use and distribution of my information, including your rights to "opt-in" or "opt-out", users of the web site who use our services to apply to various member Colleges and/or Universities will not receive any College/University specific information concerning their respective admissions process; however, we may use your email address (User Name), your home address, and your cell phone number (if you opt in) to send or mail you registration and submission confirmation texts, physical mail, and/or emails, to contact the user/applicant to help answer a technical support question that you may have posed to us regarding your use of the site and to provide you with other information relevant to your admission application process.</p>

                   <legend id="legend-col">Who is collecting information?</legend>
                   <p>When you are on the 1Application site and are asked for and provide personal information, this information is being collected by our trustworthy independent web service providers who provide all of the technical support, including collection, storage and protection of your personal information, in order to allow 1Application to offer our service to you. Please note that we and/or other trustworthy third party organizations and their contracted researchers may attempt to collect, provide our members access to, or compare personal information about you from sources other than what you voluntarily provide to us when using the web site in order to generate non-personal identifying demographic, historical, generic, analytical, statistical or aggregate data obtained from other sources, and/or data (collectively “aggregate data”) which we and/or the third party may publish, combine or enhance with other aggregate data obtained from other sources, and/or share or distribute the aggregate only data for monetary value with our members and other colleges or universities who are not members for the purpose of recruiting them to be part of our membership or with other third parties for research purposes only.</p>

                   <legend id="legend-col">With whom does 1Application share your information?</legend>
                   <p>We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.</p>
                   <p>1Application shares your personal information (including your cell phone number and email address) with our trustworthy independent web service providers who then share your personally identifiable information (including your name, date of birth, home mailing address, cell phone number and email address) with member Colleges and/or Universities. We also share your name, phone number and home address with __________________, one of our trustworthy independent web service partners, solely to confirm or “validate” the accuracy of the mailing address that you entered and to enhance the aggregate data that we and our partners are developing solely for research use. _______________ does not store this personal information. Your credit card/debit card information is collected by our partner ___________________ by way of a direct link to the ________________ web site. This information is then shared with the credit card/debit card processor that you have chosen in order to consummate online the payment of admission application fees to the Colleges and/or Universities you have selected. By voluntarily providing us with your personal information, you are giving us your express consent to share or provide access to your personal information with the aforementioned parties (and subject to this Policy and/or their privacy policy and applicable law) so that we can provide the service for which you have registered. We may also share on a temporary basis your personal information (including, but not necessarily limited to, your name and date of birth) with other trustworthy third party organizations allowing us and/or them to generate aggregate data which we and/or the third party may publish, combine or enhance with other aggregate data obtained from other sources, and/or share or distribute the aggregate only data for monetary value with our members and prospective member colleges or universities or with other third parties for research purposes only. Note that even if you never submit an application through the 1Application, the Colleges and/or Universities will still have access to the personal information that you had voluntarily submitted on any application supplement, payment or other applicant or admission related form, and such Colleges and/or Universities may contact you even prior to the time your application is submitted.</p>
                    <p>While 1Application requires that each member College and University sign a Service Agreement each year pledging that they will accept the 1Application(TM) without prejudice and fully support its use, 1Application is not responsible for the failure of any College or University to accept the 1Application(TM) or how any given College or University (after accessing or receiving your personal information from us) will use, protect or store the information in their possession. You are encouraged to review that College/University's individual privacy policies and information practices as to how they use and protect your personal information and 1Application neither accepts nor assumes any liability or responsibility for the use or protection of your personal information by said College or University.</p>
                    <p>If 1Application is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all of its assets, we will post a prominent notice on our site informing you of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.</p>  

                    <legend id="legend-col">What is 1Application’s policy when there has been an allegation of fraud, misrepresentation or other inappropriate act involving an applicant?</legend>
                    <p>Members, secondary schools and applicants are advised that 1Application functions and solely views itself as a conduit of information between the student applicant, his/her secondary school and the various member Colleges and Universities selected by the applicant. As such, it is 1Application’s policy not to judge, evaluate, conduct any verification of or perform an investigation on any data provided on or about a student applicant regardless of the source of that data. That said, where we have been informed of an act of fraud, misrepresentation or other inappropriate act involving an applicant, 1Application reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law or in any instance or circumstance when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of our members and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, police investigation, court order, or legal process served on our Web site or involving our site or associated services. Subject to any rights afforded by law, 1Application also reserves the right upon notice to an applicant to disclose information collected from a registered user about which member Colleges and/or Universities a student applicant had applied to, including possibly suspending or closing an applicant’s on-line account upon notice to the student, when we have reason to believe that accessing and/or disclosing this information or taking such action is necessary to prevent, identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating any of our on-line user agreements or policies or who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) 1Application rights or property, other 1Application users, members or schools, or to help protect anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 1Application may also disclose or access registered user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative, technical and other related purposes that we deem necessary to maintain or improve our services.</p>      

                    <legend id="legend-col" style="background: yellow;">What are your choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information, including your rights to "opt-in" or "opt- out"?</legend> 
                    <p style="background: yellow;">You have the right not to provide us with any personal information about you when you visit the site but you will not be able to utilize the service that 1Application provides unless you voluntarily decide to complete an on-line User Registration form and answer the required fields. When you first register with the 1Application site, you are given the option to "opt-in" and "opt-out" of receiving communication from member Colleges and Universities and having certain personal information released to our member Colleges and Universities on your "My Colleges List" prior to submission of your application to that selected member College or University. You must affirmatively "opt-in" or "opt-out" according to your preference. Should you "opt-in," you can later change your mind and "opt-out" for any member College or University by using the "Unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of the email you receive from that member College or University. Alternatively, you may "opt-out" for all member Colleges and Universities by appropriately changing the setting located on your "Account Maintenance" page. You can access the "Account Maintenance" page by clicking on the Settings icon in the upper right hand corner of your application after logging in.
</p>       
                    <p style="background: yellow;">Should you choose to "opt-in," a limited amount of the personal information that you provided us will be released to your designated member Colleges and Universities prior to submission of your application to those selected members. If you decide to "opt-in", you can also contact Technical Support by clicking "Help Center" at www.1application.in in order to determine what specific portion of the personal information that you provided us is sent to your designated member Colleges and Universities prior to application submission. In addition, your "opting-in" will allow member Colleges and Universities to use the 1Application email system to contact you at any time and/or to text you at your cell phone number.</p>  
                    <p style="background: yellow;">Should you choose the default "opt-out" option, a more limited amount of your personal information that you had provided us is released to your selected member Colleges and Universities. If you choose to "opt-out," you can also contact Technical Support by clicking "Help Center " at www.1application.in in order to determine what specific portion of the personal information that you provided us is sent to your designated member Colleges and Universities prior to application submission. In addition, your decision to adopt the default "opt-out" setting shall prevent member Colleges and Universities from texting you or from using the 1Application email system to contact you until such time as you submit an application, supplement, or payment to that member College or University.</p>
                    <p style="background: yellow;">Once registered, while you are free not to provide any personal information requested on the 1Application(TM), any application supplement or other applicant form, to do so may cause the member College and/or University that you select not to accept the application, supplement or other applicant form as complete and consequently this may delay the application admission process or reject the submission as incomplete regardless of payment. Users/applicants can also decide not to provide information that is designated as "optional" on any application, supplement or other form and still utilize the service that we provide. Users should communicate with their designated College and/or University directly if any admission application is delayed or rejected or otherwise results in an outcome that does not satisfy the applicant's expectations.</p>

                    <legend id="legend-col">What is 1Application's policy on allowing you to access, update, correct, or delete your personally identifiable information?</legend>
                    <p>You may access and edit your registration information by using your User Name (your email address) and password. If you have forgotten your password, please click the "Forgot Password?" link at <a href="http://www.1application.in">www.1application.in</a> to have your password emailed to you. For all other problems signing in to 1Application, please click "Help Center" at <a href="http://www.1application.in">www.1application.in</a>. If you wish for us to delete or no longer use any of your personal information that you submitted to us, you may email us with such a request at <a href="mailto:privacy@1application.in">privacy@1application.in</a> and your personal information will be deleted or no longer used within ten (10) business days after receiving your request. See "What kind of security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information including credit card/debit card information and how is your information stored, accessed and used by others?"</p>
                    <p>1Application, through its independent trustworthy web service providers will make reasonable efforts to see that your instructions to make revisions to your personal information are made. For any information that was erroneously provided by the applicant but was already submitted and can no longer be changed or re-submitted, you must contact the College/University or credit card/debit card processor directly to alert them to the erroneous information.</p>
                    <p>You may also update your email address and cell phone number within your on-line profile, application or supplement, though once your email address information has been submitted to a selected member College/University, you can only update your email address and cell phone number if you contact that member College/University directly.</p>

                    <legend id="legend-col">What kind of security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information including credit card/debit card information and how is your information stored, accessed and used by others?</legend>
                    <p>Your User Registration information is password-protected. You may edit your User Registration information by using your User Name (your email address) and password.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Also remember to sign out of your 1Application registration account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer or other electronic device with someone else or are using a computer or other electronic device in a public place like a library or Internet "cafe." Also, to help ensure the security of your application, do not copy and paste links from within the online application into an email or share with others on a public forum. If you do not log out of the online system, users with technical knowledge may use these links to access your online application.</p>
                    <p>When you make submissions of the 1Application, supplements or other applicant forms to designated member Colleges or Universities or when you access your user registered account information from our web site, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us, including your credit card/debit card information. We also restrict access to the secure server through the use of firewalls.</p>
                     <p>When you give 1Application personal information on-line, that information is viewed by 1Application and its trustworthy independent web service providers for the purpose of providing technical support for the services being provided to you. This information is then accessed by the designated member Colleges and/or Universities with whom you select by logging into the secure system of our trustworthy independent web site service providers. Consequently, your personal information can then be viewed, printed and/or exported electronically to the designated member Colleges and/or Universities which are located outside and separate from the 1Application web site and outside of the jurisdiction where you originally entered the information.</p>
                     <p>Credit Card/Debit Card Payments: 1Application, working with our trustworthy independent web service provider for credit card/debit card payments (____________________), allows applicants to pay admissions application fees online using a credit card/debit card. This collection of credit card information by ____________is accomplished by directly linking you to the ____________________ web site when you are ready to submit your credit card/debit card information. This feature is designed to accept ONE credit card/debit card transaction if you click "Submit" ONE time. However, if you click "Submit" more than once, it is possible your account will have a duplicate charge. Our member Colleges and/or Universities will reverse charges for any duplicate transaction. HOWEVER, NEITHER COLLEGE APPLICATION PVT. LTD., ITS MEMBER COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES, NOR THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS OF COLLEGE APPLICATION PVT. LTD. WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR REFUNDING ANY PROCESSING FEES INCURRED BY THE INCORRECT USE OF THIS FEATURE. Accordingly, to avoid duplicate charges, please do not click the credit card/debit card SUBMIT button more than once! Your credit card/debit card information is not stored by us but is immediately transmitted under encryption to your designated credit card/debit card processor, and none of your personal information is stored on your computer or other electronic device or a computer of the College or University that would allow someone to by-pass the login authentication procedures.</p>
                     <p>1Application web site, through the secure servers of our trustworthy independent web server providers, retains your personal information for the entire application admissions cycle which ends on or____________ of  each calendar year. Once the web site closes for the academic year in ______________, your personal information is removed or "archived" off the "live" servers and "backed-up" to a separate secured remote server for storage (at least until overwritten when space is needed to back-up more recent data) where no one can access it except on a very limited basis by us or our trustworthy independent web service provider responsible for storage of your personal information. Unless under order of the Court, your application once archived remains irretrievable. Therefore, you are strongly advised to print out for your own records a hard copy of all 1Application(TM) forms that you have completed.</p>
                     <p>Note that the reasons for granting us continued limited access to your personal information from the remote server may include, but are not necessarily limited to, allowing us, our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners, or member Colleges/Universities to compile aggregate or historical information about applications submitted in previous years. For statistical purposes, your personal information will be used only in the aggregate meaning that personal identifying information such as your name shall not be used. For some historical purposes, however, we and our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners, including member Colleges/Universities and non-member colleges and universities will have continued access to your archived personal identifying information as we and/or our trustworthy independent web service providers or other partners deem necessary.</p>
                     <p>Please note that whenever your personal information is handled as described above, regardless of where this occurs, steps are taken to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. When you enter sensitive information on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet or electronic handling can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us online, including any information that you send or receive as an email or text message that is sent or received over your own email domain account or cell phone service, and you do so at your own risk. ALSO, THE 1APPLICATION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE AND DOES NOT ASSUME ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY TEXTS, EMAILS OR OTHER COMMUNICATIONS THAT YOU RECEIVE FROM OR SEND TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS, AND WE CANNOT ACCEPT LIABILITY FOR DISCLOSURE OF ANY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION DUE TO ERRORS IN TRANSMISSION OR UNAUTHORIZED OR ILLEGAL ACTS OF THIRD PARTIES.</p>

                     <legend id="legend-col">Does 1Application have an identity theft policy?</legend>
                     <p>While rare, the risk of identity theft to on-line users of the Internet is on the rise and 1Application recognizes the importance of taking steps to help its student applicants, users, customers and members identify and detect patterns, practices or activities that may indicate the existence of identity theft involving the 1APP Online services and 1Application web site, including implementing the appropriate actions or responses to help safeguard against and/or mitigate the risk of future or continued theft. Please read carefully the identity theft portions of this Policy before using the 1App online services and/or its web site.</p>
                     <p>The identity theft portions of this Policy are to help all 1Application users identify theft and to provide them with information about what steps 1Application takes to detect identity theft, safeguard against, respond to and/or mitigate continued or future identity theft involving the 1App Online service and 1Application web site.</p>
                     <p>Please also note that the identity theft portions of this Policy also only address 1Application’s identity theft policy concerning activities involving its own web site and service and it does not apply to activities or identity theft policies of others or other web sites or apps independent from, referenced or linked to the 1Application web site, such as web sites, apps or IT systems of secondary schools, member colleges or universities or other third parties or any individuals or officials that may be associated with these other institutions or third parties.</p>

                    <legend id="legend-col">What kinds of patterns, practices or activities may indicate the existence of identity theft?</legend>
                    <p>In order to be on-guard for possible identity theft, all student applicants, users, customers and members should be aware of the potential indicators of identity theft. These may include but are not necessarily limited to the following:</p>
                    <p>Receiving an alert, notification or warning from a consumer reporting agency</p>
                    <p>Receiving notification of a credit freeze or address discrepancy</p>
                    <p>Receiving notification of an abnormal increase in the number of credit inquiries, new credit relationships or new credit uses</p>
                    <p>Receiving notification of an account being involuntarily closed or a credit abuse being identified</p>
                    <p>Receiving or becoming aware of suspicious documents, information or photos provided for identification that appear to have been altered or forged or are inconsistent with other authenticated and accessible personal identifying information</p>
                    <p>Receiving or becoming aware of suspicious documents, information or photos provided for identification that appear to be associated with prior fraudulent practices or activities or are attributable to another student applicant, user, customer, member or other third party</p>
                    <p>Any unusual use of or suspicious activity involving or relating to any account that is held with 1Application</p>

                    <legend id="legend-col">What steps does 1Application take to detect identity theft or breaches of personal data?</legend>
                    <p>1Application primarily functions as an information and document conduit between students that apply to various member colleges and universities using the 1App Online service and 1Application web site and the various secondary school officials and members that also utilize the service and site. While 1Application through its trustworthy web service providers deploys several security measures to protect the personal identifying information (including credit card/debit card information) of its users (see the section on security precautions in place discussed in this Policy), such security measures may not always prevent the crime of identity theft due to the specific nature of this crime. Accordingly, 1Application must also rely upon the credible reporting of suspicious patterns, practices or activities of identity theft from its trustworthy student applicants, users, customers, members or school officials.</p>
                    <p>In this connection, any student applicant, user, school official or member that becomes aware of any suspicious pattern, practice or activity suggestive of an identity theft that also involves or relates to the 1App Online service or 1Application web site is urged to notify 1Application via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@1application.in">privacy@1application.in</a>. Please be sure to disclose your name, all relevant information about the suspected identity theft including information about how you may be contacted.</p>

                     <legend id="legend-col">What steps does 1Application take to safeguard against, respond to and/or mitigate continued or future identity theft or breaches of personal data?</legend>
                     <p>Upon receiving credible information about a possible identity theft or other possible related wrongdoing involving or relating to 1App Online service or 1Application web site from a trustworthy student applicant, user, customer, member, school official or other trustworthy third party, 1Application will do what it reasonably can to investigate the merits of the claim by gathering up any other information within its reasonable control in order to evaluate whether there has been a possible attempt to commit identity theft or other possible related wrongdoing. If 1Application believes there are grounds for believing in good faith that an attempt at wrongdoing was made, 1Application reserves the right to cancel or close an offending or possible tainted transaction or account, monitor a particular account or line of communication, change applicable security codes, notify law enforcement officials, notify the victim of the alleged attempted fraud or other wrongdoing, provide to the victim certain information (including the personal identifying information of another user) if reasonably requested or justified and/or do such other acts reasonable and/or necessary to protect 1Application and/or victim of the alleged theft or other possible wrongdoing and otherwise comply with any data breach notification or identity theft law that is applicable to the particular circumstance. 1Application also reserves the right not to take any action if no such action is warranted. Finally, 1Application reserves the right to rely upon its trustworthy independent web service providers to help implement, safeguard against and/or mitigate continued or future identity theft or other possible wrongdoing involving any student applicant, user, customer, member or school official when the alleged theft or other possible wrongdoing involves or is related to the 1App Online service or 1Application web site.</p>
